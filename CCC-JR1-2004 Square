'''Write a program that asks the userfor the number of tiles and then prints out the
maximum side length. You may assume that the user will only type integers that are less
than ten thousand. Once your program has read the userâ€™s input and printed the largest
square, your program stops executing.'''
# Input
tiles = int(input("Enter number of tiles: "))
# Processing
side = 1
for s in range(1,101):
    sqr = s * s
    if sqr <= tiles:
        if (sqr == tiles):
            side = s
        else:
            side = s
# Output         
print("The largest square has side length ", side)
